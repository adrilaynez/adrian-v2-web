# Building Distributed Systems in Rust

Rust's ownership model is uniquely suited for concurrent systems.

## Async/Await in Rust

The `Future` trait is at the core of Rust's async system.

```rust
use std::future::Future;

async function hello_world() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

## The Actor Model

Using libraries like `actix`, we can build systems that scale horizontally easily.

```rust
use actix::prelude::*;

struct MyActor;

impl Actor for MyActor {
    type Context = Context<Self>;
}
```

This pattern prevents shared mutable state issues by design.
