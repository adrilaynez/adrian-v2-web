The current paradigm of large language models (LLMs) has reached a saturation point in terms of compute efficiency. As we scale towards 100T+ parameter models, the dense activation patterns of Transformers become increasingly unsustainable.

In this research note, I explore a hypothetical architecture I've been calling **"Sparse Distributed Manifolds" (SDM)**, which combines ideas from Kanerva's Sparse Distributed Memory with modern attention mechanisms.

## The Bottleneck of Dense Attention

Standard self-attention scales quadratically with sequence length $L$:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

While techniques like FlashAttention have optimized the IO-bound operations, the fundamental $O(L^2)$ complexity remains for global context.

  Biological systems do not perform dense matrix multiplications. They operate on **sparse, event-driven** principles where only a fraction of neurons fire at any given timestamp.

## Proposed Architecture: SDM-Net

SDM-Net proposes a routing layer that maps tokens to a high-dimensional sparse manifold. Instead of attending to *all* tokens, a query attends only to the "active set" of memories that lie within a Hamming distance threshold.

### Mathematical Formulation

Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a manifold defined by a set of basis vectors $\{b_1, ..., b_k\}$. A token embedding $x$ is projected onto this manifold via a sparse coding step:

$$
\alpha^* = \operatorname*{argmin}_\alpha ||x - D\alpha||_2^2 + \lambda ||\alpha||_1
$$

Where $D$ is the dictionary of basis vectors.

### Implementation Preview (Rust)

I've been prototyping the sparse projection kernel in Rust using explicit SIMD instructions for Hamming distance calculations.

```rust
use std::simd::u8x64;

pub fn hamming_distance_simd(a: &[u8], b: &[u8]) -> u32 {
    let mut distance = 0;
    let chunks_a = a.chunks_exact(64);
    let chunks_b = b.chunks_exact(64);
    
    // Process 64 bytes at a time using AVX-512
    for (chunk_a, chunk_b) in chunks_a.zip(chunks_b) {
        let vec_a = u8x64::from_slice(chunk_a);
        let vec_b = u8x64::from_slice(chunk_b);
        let xor = vec_a ^ vec_b;
        distance += xor.count_ones(); // Hypothetical API
    }
    
    distance as u32
}
```

## Preliminary Results

Initial benchmarks on the **WikiText-103** dataset show a 40% reduction in training FLOPs with comparable perplexity to a standard GPT-2 small baseline.

1.  **Sparsity**: 95% of activations are zero.
2.  **Throughput**: 3x inference speedup on CPU.
3.  **Memory**: Linear scaling with context length.

## Future Directions

The next phase involves scaling this to a 7B parameter model and training on a slice of the RedPajama dataset. I am particularly interested in how **SDM-Net** handles long-form reasoning tasks where maintaining coherent state over thousands of tokens is critical.

Stay tuned for the open-source release of the training harness.
